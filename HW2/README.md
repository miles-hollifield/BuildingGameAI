# CSC 484/585 Homework 2

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates and explores various movement algorithms using SFML:  
- **Part 1**: Variable Matching Steering Behaviors.  
- **Part 2**: Arrive and Align implementations.
- **Part 3**: Wander Steering Behaviors.
- **Part 4**: Flocking Behavior and Blending/Arbitration.

## **Compilation**
Run the following command in the terminal once you are in the project directory to build the project:  
```
make
```
This will produce four executables:
- `hw2pt1`: Demonstrates Part 1 of the assignment.
- `hw2pt2`: Demonstrates Part 2 of the assignment.
- `hw2pt3`: Demonstrates Part 3 of the assignment.
- `hw2pt4`: Demonstrates Part 4 of the assignment.

## **Execution**
Run either of these commands to execute their respective programs:
```
./hw2pt1
./hw2pt2
./hw2pt3
./hw2pt4
```

## **Cleanup**
To clean the project, run this command:
```
make clean
```
