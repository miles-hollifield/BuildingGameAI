## **Overview**
This project demonstrates sprite movement using SFML in a VGA resolution window (640x480):  
- **Part 2**: Moves a single sprite from left to right across the screen.  
- **Part 3**: Demonstrates coordinated movement of multiple sprites in a rectangular pattern.

## **Compilation**
Run the following command to build the project:  
```
make
```
This will produce two executables:
- `part2`: Demonstrates Part 2 of the assignment.
- `part3`: Demonstrates Part 3 of the assignment.

## **Execution**
- Run either of these commands to execute their respective programs:
  - `./part2`
  - `./part3`
